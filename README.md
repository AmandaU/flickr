# flickr


- This app is written in SwiftUI
- A more custom search control has been written, in place of the iOS 16 searchable control, in order to give more control over showing of the history
- The config file, which contains the api key, should not be committed to git under normal circumstances. However, in order to honour the request to minimise the setup steps, I have inlcuded it in the gitignore file (the config exclusion is now commented out)
- This app caters for all platforms and all orientations (i.e. iphone , ipad, mac (maccatalyst). Landscape and Portrait)
- An enlarged version of each photo can be obtained by clicking on the image in the grid , and the ability to share it has been included
